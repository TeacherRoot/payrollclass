Payroll Class Template

In this assignment we will create a Payroll class that determines an employee's gross pay.  THe gross pay is calculated as the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly pay rate.  This class also has the abiliyt to calculate overtime pay if more than 40 hours were worked.  The empolyee earns 1.5 times his/her regular hourly pay rate for all hours over 40.  


Here is an outline for the Payroll class

public class Payroll {
    private double hoursWorked;
    private double payRate;

    void setHoursWorked(double h)
    void setPayRate(double pr)
    double getHoursWorked()
    double getPayRate()
    double getGrossPay()

}
   
# Use the GrossPay class to test your Payroll class.  Add 3 more tests for a total of 4.
